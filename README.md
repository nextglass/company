####About
Join us in revolutionizing how people enjoy wine. Help us make every next glass, the perfect glass. Next Glass™ is like Pandora® for wine, delivering great wine recommendations every time. Give us one glass you love and we'll make sure you never drink a bad wine again. Our scientific methods remove the vague adjectives from wine descriptions, leaving only the true essence of each wine and making choosing your next glass as easy as drinking it. How's it work? We match your favorites to bottles in our Wine Genome Cellar&trade; to find the ones that are perfect for you.

####The Solution
What wine will I enjoy? More than 2 million consumers turn to the Internet for the answer to this question every day. But the Internet is filled with bad information, biased opinions and adjective-laden wine descriptions. Current recommenders like Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast and Robert Parker only cause more confusion. Their mysterious ratings and adjective-based reviews do little to help consumers decide which wine to buy.  And on top of that, they can't even agree amongst themselves! Next Glass solves this problem by removing subjectivity and applying science to deliver recommendations based on your previous ratings. For consumers, it means your next great glass is on its way. For businesses, it means you’re closer to knowing what customers want.
